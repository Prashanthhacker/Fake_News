# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project is an AI-based system that detects whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real** using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

---

## Features
- Uses real-world datasets (`Fake.csv` and `True.csv`)
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Logistic Regression classifier
- High accuracy performance
- **Tkinter-based GUI application** for real-time news prediction
- Simple and user-friendly interface

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Tkinter  

---

## Dataset
The project uses two CSV files:
- `Fake.csv` – contains fake news articles  
- `True.csv` – contains real news articles  

Each dataset includes:
